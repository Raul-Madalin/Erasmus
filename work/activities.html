				<p> <img src="GALLERY/sigla-36700.jpg" alt="erasmus+" width="15%" style="float: left"> &emsp;&emsp; Erasmus+ IT CAREER START-UP Erasmus+ Project, 2017-1-RO01-KA102-036700, Beneficiary “Gheorghe Vranceanu” National College, Bacau, Romania was funded by the European Commission, facilitating inter-institutional cooperation between partner institutions, 4 schools and 16 companies  from Cyprus, Spain and Portugal, in order to support students’ career orientation towards the IT sector. As such, Universal Mobility S.L, Valencia,   intermediary organization for Spain, enabled a 3-week practical training (09.07.2018-27.07.2018) within 8 IT companies for 16 Romanian students. </p>
				
				<p> &emsp;&emsp; MBB Electronics S.L., Droid House S.L., Asociacion Cultural TotArt S.L, Eventos Samsara SL, Dynos Informática S.L., Inforlandia S.L., Mundotec SL, Idea y Diseña S.L provided student placements aimed at acquiring professional skills for creating web pages using Adobe Dreamweaver.  The recognition of the acquired competences was done through the Europass Mobility document. </p>
				
				<p> &emsp;&emsp; The project had a positive impact on the participants, who had a first European mobility experience and acquired professional, personal, civic, intercultural and linguistic skills by working in a multicultural team and context. In the long run, they will be more competitive on the labour market, being more prepared and motivated to choose an IT career in Romania or abroad. </p>

				<p> <img src="GALLERY/home2.jpg" alt="home2" width="33%" style="float: right"> &emsp;&emsp;As "children's theater" is understood the way of doing theater that children have. When we add "children's theater course" it will be understood as the way children learn to do theater.</p>
				
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;The mind is nourished by experience, knowledge, ... in short, learning, and discipline in daily life, as well as human relationships and the environment. On the other hand, there is a part that nobody pays attention to but that we all have, and that is the one of our experiences. These experiences that we all have and do but that neither internalize nor analyze them, and are those that serve us for the construction of different characters. For this we have to pay attention to everything that surrounds us, those around us, what happens and how it happens.</p>
				
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;An actor has to have discipline as in all learning, but at the same time he has to be carried away by what he needs to do or express at every moment.</p>

				<p> <img src="GALLERY/home3.jpg" alt="home3" width="33%" style="float: left"> &emsp;&emsp;If you are looking for an artistic school for your children during the school holidays, here we offer you a different and fun education with which you will learn much more than numbers and letters, and where you will enter the world of emotions, the arts and happiness. Totart proposes you to develop your physical and artistic qualities through games. Activities that can only be found in Totart due to its multidisciplinary courses.</p>

				<p> <img src="GALLERY/home4.jpg" alt="home4" width="33%" style="float: right"> &emsp;&emsp;It is an acrobatic and artistic discipline that allows the creation of static and dynamic figures suspended in the air.</p>
				
				<p>Using fabrics to raise, lower, control weight, balance, strength, muscle intensity and endurance, it is possible to create scores of choreographic movements, with the idea of achieving a "human flight", light, graceful and energetic to the Same time.</p>
				
				<p> The Aerial Fabrics is a discipline of the most complete, since it works all the muscles of the body and the capacity of mental concentration.</p>

				<p>&emsp;&emsp;Activities that can only be found in Totart due to its multidisciplinary courses.</p>
				
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;The Totart art center offers a series of theatrical, musical, physical and artistic activities for children.</p>
				
				<p>&emsp;&emsp;We do not intend that children revive the school year, we will work with them from the game and the playful elements, making them participants of each workshop and each activity. We will integrate the children in an informal but controlled environment, trying to enhance their skills and attitudes without forgetting that it is a holiday period and that they come to have fun.</p>
